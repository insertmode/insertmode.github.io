<p>There are not enough skilled software developers in this world that we can ask to build the web applications that we want to exist. That's why we need to get more people into programming and educate them in all fields required to work in a distributed team.</p>

<p>There is no lack of free learning resources on the Internet. What people need however, is orientation, a path through all the free tutorials out there. They need help in deciding <em>what</em> to learn and in what <em>order</em>. We show then <em>one</em> path to knowledge and social compatibility. This means we are <em>opinionated</em> about technology.</p>

<p>Our learning environment will emphasise collaboration and communication. From a very early stage on, students will have pair programming sessions with peers that have similar skill set. They will review each other's code and help improving the learning experience.</p>
