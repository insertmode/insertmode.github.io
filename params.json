{"name":"INSERT MODE","tagline":"putting people into tech","body":"### Creating Learning Platforms for Social Coding\r\n\r\nThere are not enough skilled software developers in this world that we can ask to build the web applications that we want to exist. That's why we need to get more people into programming and educate them in all fields required to work in a distributed team.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of free learning resources on the Internet. What people need however, is orientation, a path through all the free tutorials out there. They need help in deciding _what_ to learn and in what _order_. We show then *one* path to knowledge and social compatibility. This means we are _opinionated_ about technology.\r\n\r\nOur learning environment will emphasise collaboration and communication. From a very early stage on, students will have pair programming sessions with peers that have similar skill set. They will review each other's code and help improving the learning experience.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
